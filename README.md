# JSONSession

Support for periodic polling of a server endpoint.

Authentication is passed in the `Authorization` header, as `bearer <token>`. 

The response is expected to contain an `Etag` header field, which represents the current state of the endpoint, and is passed back to the server with subsequent requests.

This mechanism allows efficient polling of the server for changes, and can be a workaround for rate-limiting (where requests that didn't pick up any change in state don't count towards the rate limit).

## Made For Github

This is a generalisation of some code I built to access the Github API, and is used by [Octoid](https://github.com/elegantchaos/Octoid) which is a more general Github library.

I split out the JSONSession functionality because I imagined that other servers may use the same mechanism. This may be an incorrect assumption, and/or this code may need to be generalised further to work with other servers. If so, let me know via an issue.
